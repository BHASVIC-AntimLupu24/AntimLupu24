# About me
Hi, my name is Antim Lupu and I'm a college student at Bhasvic studying Maths, Further maths, Economics and Computer Science.
My professional goals are to attend a top university in the UK, cambridge or LSE, to study economics and then break into finance.
I am interested in investment banking at JP Morgan or Goldmansachs or private equity and as a result I am currently partaking in investment banking virtual work experience from Citadel and JP Morgan.
I am currently working on an Assest correlation analyser in my A Level Computer Science NEA which is a program that analyses whether there is any relationship between two stocks.
I believe I work well in a team due to my communication skills as its very important to have a good relationship with the people your in a team with in case of any issues that need to be resolved.
