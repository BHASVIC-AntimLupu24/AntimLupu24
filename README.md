# AntimLupu24
My personal repository.
Hi, my name is Antim Lupu and I'm a college student at Bhasvic studying Maths, Further maths, Economics and Computer Science.
My professional goals are to attend a top university in the UK, cambridge or LSE, to study economics and then break into finance.
I am interested in investment banking at JP Morgan or Goldmansachs.
I am currently working on an Assest correlation analyser which is a program that analyses whether there is any relationship between two stocks.
I work well in a team due to my communication skills. This is seen in my latest project animalopoly where I didnt understand how to write this part of my code and so I went to my teammates for help.
